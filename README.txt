Image Writer for Microsoft Windows
Release 1.0.1 Beyond [2019-08-15]
======
This fork (based on 1.0.0) adds ignored_drives.cfg config file to skip/ignore/blacklist drives.

This allows to workaround issues with virtual drives, mapped network drives and subst drives.
But also speeds up startup and can protect you from accidental deletion of important drives/files.
See ignored_drives.cfg for details.
